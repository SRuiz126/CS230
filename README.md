Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
Our client The Gaming Room wanted to make the software functionality better but also wanted to expand to multiple platform. The document was clear and to the point. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
It helps when you are trying to focus on a certain task and when you are trying to decide which tasks are and are not that important. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Recommendations because it was difficult for me to decide. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the needs of the user which were speed and usability. A user will probably keep using an ap if they dont like the look but they will stop using the app alogether if it is slow and unusable. User needs are a must because they are the ultimate source of revenue for us 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Started with broad ideas and narrowed down to specifics. We seperated the needs and requirements and made sure we got it right the first time to allow for easier updates and maintenance.
